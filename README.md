                                  Linux - Shell Programming
Recently, I started learning Shell (Bash) scripting â€” a powerful way to automate tasks, improve productivity, and dive deeper into Linux systems.

Hereâ€™s a quick roadmap I followed:

ðŸ”¹ Understanding Shell â€“ the bridge between user and OS.
ðŸ”¹ Basic Commands â€“ pwd, ls, cd, mkdir, cp, mv, echo.
ðŸ”¹ First Script â€“ writing a simple hello.sh and running it with chmod +x.
ðŸ”¹ Variables & Loops â€“ using for, if-else, and dynamic variables.
ðŸ”¹ Practical Scripts â€“ automating backups, renaming files, monitoring system usage.
ðŸ”¹ Next Steps â€“ exploring cron jobs, functions, grep, awk, sed, and system monitoring.

Along the way, I practiced creating files with touch, writing content using echo, and editingâœ¨.

Shell scripting is not just coding â€” itâ€™s about making the system work for you. This journey has been both challenging and rewarding, and Iâ€™m excited to apply it in automation, DevOps, and cybersecurity contexts.
